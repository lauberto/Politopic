# politopic
This repository is a work in progress. The goal is collecting NLP techniques that can be used to analyse politicians' speeches, their social media posts and any other content they might produce. So far, the [`notebook`](https://github.com/lauberto/politopic/tree/main/notebook) folder includes an example in which topic modelling (also with [BERTopic](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic)) was applied to [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) transcriptions of videos from [Matteo Salvini's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MatteoSalviniOfficial). I thought it would have been interesting to start with a far-right populist politician. BERTopic makes topic visualization possible, and the results are exciting!
